Project Write-Up:  Snacker's Point.
 Introduction: 
This project is online food ordering website aimed at providing a convenient platform for users to browse, view and purchase food items online. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. I have developed a user-friendly website that provide a great shopping experience. 
Files inside this project: 
To do this project, I have created following HTML, CSS and JS files.
Index.html
Products.html
Cart.html
Checkout.html
Whishlist.html
Style.css
Scripts.js
Signmodel.js

1.	index.html: This is the home page of our website that contains all html code for displaying food items
•	It contains header, main carousel for advertisement or offers, variety of food section, food items carousel and footer 
•	I have connected scripts.js and signmodel.js file with this file, so that all food items are dynamically updated inside main section via html string template literal which is described inside scripts.js file. 
•	In variety of food section if you click on order now it will redidrect over product.html page

2.	Products.html: 
•	This page display all products by filter
•	Product will sort as per filter option. 
 

3.	cart.html: 
•	This contains all the html codes for displaying cart items that user has been add to cart from home page and wishlist.html page of this website. 
•	It also contains order summary of the cart items

4.	checkout.html: 
•	This contains all the html codes for displaying checkoute items that user has been addd to cart from home page and wishlist.html page of this website. 
•	It also contains order summary of the items.

6.	style.css: 
This is used to style all the pages inside this website.
7.	scripts.js: 
•	All food items are dynamically updated inside main section
•	This file is mainly created to add functionality to all buttons (wishlist, add to cart, remove from whishlidt etc) for related food items. •
•	 Due to presence of this file, when a user click on wishlist button, wishlist btn color will be changed and wishlist item added and it will redirect over wishlist items page.
•	Similar concept has been used for cart items
•	Display checkout item and order summary. 
•	Pay now button redirection.
